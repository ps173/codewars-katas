Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:  
     
                  1
               3     5
            7     9    11
        13    15    17    19
     21    23    25    27    29
     ...

Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle  
(starting at index 1) e.g.:

    rowSumOddNumbers(1); // 1
    rowSumOddNumbers(2); // 3 + 5 = 8

# How to solve ?

This quite easy. But long(atleast that's what I thought initially check the   
comment at end of my solution that is a much better way simple maths)
